# Ebook-Automation

A little node.js script for automating some of the more tedious jobs that are involved in making an ebook.

**Warning: this is an idiosyncratic script that works for me and my clients. You will need to make changes to make it work for you, it will not work out of the box.** Not yet, anyway.

## Using this script

1. Clone or fork this repo
2. Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
3. Navigate to the cloned folder in your terminal
4. Run `npm install` in your terminal
5. Either copy the .epub file you want to process into the cloned folder, or get its filepath
6. Run `node index.js` if you copied the file in, or `node index.js "<filepath>"` if you didn't

There is also `node amzn.js` for turning your .epub file into a .mobi file using kindlegen.

## Configuration

Coming soon...!
