    <h1 class="chaptit">A Tiger Leaves His Mark</h1>

    <p class="noindsb"><small>IN MID-JUNE,</small> we began research for our sec- ond expedition. We planned to look around the valley called Dipiko first and then move on to nearby Santago Valley. We would travel along Santago River, over the Dragon Spine, up Siaoka River, and down again. Dr. Galina Salkina, a tiger researcher and good friend, had decided to accompany Valosia (her husband) and me on the trip, which would extend over seventy kilometers. The other team would survey the regions up Siaoka River, traveling upstream.</p>

    <p class="ind">Santago River weaves through many parts of the lowlands of the Sikhote-Alin and cuts through the middle of Lazovsky. The deep valley formed along the river is Santago, the estimated northern border of Bloody Mary’s territory. Between Santago and a prominent part of the mountain ridge is Dipiko. Both Santago and Dipiko were named by the Udege. The “go” of <em>Santago</em> and “ko” of <em>Dipiko</em> have different pronunciations, but both mean “large valley.” <em>Dipiko</em> means “the valley frequented by hunters,” which reveals that the valley was once populated by many animals.</p>

    <p class="ind">These two inland valleys have healthy nut pine and oak forests. The dense oak forest in Dipiko is an especially rare, vibrant forest. Most of it is made up of Mongolian oaks, and they had produced a great harvest of acorns that year.</p>

    <p class="ind">On the Dipiko mountain ridge was an unusual area where a large puddle had formed. I had found many wild boar tracks around the puddle recently. The wild boars had taken a mud bath in the puddle and then rubbed their shoulders against nearby oak trunks. Some mud traces on the trunks came all the way up to my chest.</p>

    <p class="ind">Walking along the forest path, I came across more tracks. They looked similar to tiger cub tracks. Many sets of prints were intermingled. I looked closer and saw that the paw width was small and that there were clear claw marks above the toes. The tracks actually belonged to animals in the Canidae family.</p>

    <p class="ind">Animal tracks from the cat family and dog family are so similar that it’s hard for the untrained eye to tell them apart. But if you look carefully, there are four crucial differences.</p>

    <p class="ind">First, claw marks. Animals in the cat family retract their sickle-shaped claws when they walk and extend them only when they are digging them into their prey or climbing steep hills full of rocks. Because they extend their claws only when they need them, the claws don’t show up on their prints. Animals in the dog family, on the other hand, cannot retract their claws, so claw marks show up in their prints every time.</p>

    <p class="ind">Second, the size and shape of the paw. The prints of an animal in the cat family will always be wider than the prints of a similarly sized animal in the dog family. People often mistake large dog prints for tiger prints simply based on the size. This is because dog prints tend to look large thanks to dogs’ more spread-out toes. But if you look carefully, you’ll see that, for example, a fully grown mastiff’s paw is far narrower than the paw of a tiger cub. In addition, a cat’s paw is shaped like a trapezoid, while a dog’s is like a triangle.</p>

    <p class="ind">Third, the length-to-width ratio of the print. Cat tracks are circular, overall, with more or less equal length to width, but dog tracks are more oval, with length greater than width. Foxes have the longest print, followed by wolves, and then dogs. Tigers’ back paws also make prints that are slightly longer than they are wide, but their front paws leave prints that have an equal length-to-width ratio or sometimes even greater width than length. Some people call tiger prints “apricot flower prints” because the four toes and paw together resemble an apricot blossom.</p>

    <div class="image"><img alt="11133.png" src="../Images/11133.png"/></div>

    <p class="ind">Last, the position of the toes. In tiger prints, the second toe is positioned the highest, followed by the third, first, and then the fourth. Researchers look at the second toe to tell if the print comes from the right paw or the left. If the toe in the highest position is the second from the left, you’re looking at the right paw; if it’s second from the right, you’re looking at the left paw. The second and third toes of an animal from the dog family, however, are at the same height. This makes it difficult to tell if the print comes from the left paw or right. Also, tiger toes are closer to the ball of the paws, giving them an organized, drawn-together look, unlike the toes of canines, which splay out.</p>

    <p class="ind">We followed the prints and found a deer carcass. Its head and legs were gone, and many bites were taken from the remaining carcass. This was typical of a canine hunt. Canines hunt in groups and tear at the prey all over. The tiger, however, hunts alone and kills its prey in one bite by snapping its neck. If the prey is too big to kill by snapping its neck in one bite (like a large stag, a wild boar, or a bear), the tiger suffocates it by clamping down on the windpipe. And so the carcasses of tiger kills have only four fang marks on the front or back of the neck. This deer was killed by dogs that had left their human masters and grown wild. An increasing number of Ussuri deer were being hunted by wild dogs lately, some of them drowning or falling to their deaths in their attempts to escape.</p>

    <p class="ind">Wild dogs also hunt ungulates, but tigers and poachers usually get to them first. When a poacher hunts a deer, it just takes the meat and leaves behind the head, legs, large bones, and skin to lighten the load. Tigers also leave behind the head, legs, and large bones when they hunt deer, so at first glance, the deer carcass left behind by a tiger and a poacher may seem more or less the same. But if you look closer, you can see the difference.</p>

    <p class="ind">Poachers leave behind human footprints and the tracks of hunting dogs, along with bullet casings and jeep tire tracks. Tigers leave behind their own set of tracks and a trail of the animal being dragged. If the tracks have disappeared, look at the carcass. Poachers leave knife marks on a deer’s skin and bones because they skin the deer whole. Tigers, on the other hand, pull out all the fur with their front teeth and then eat the skin as well. Also, while poachers leave behind all the deer’s internal organs, tigers eat the organs and leave behind the contents of the deer stomach and intestines. Poachers leave the deer head intact, including the scalp, but an especially hungry tiger sometimes takes a bite out of the deer’s cheeks, the back of the head, and the scalp, leaving just the skull. The carcass left behind gives important clues to the cause of the deer’s demise.</p>

    <p class="ind">Nature includes both living spirits and the traces they leave, as well as all the intuitions that surround them. When I say traces, I’m referring to physical evidence that living things like tigers leave: pugmarks, droppings, claw marks, and other such signs. By intuitions, I don’t mean just assumptions and feelings. I’m referring to objective intuitions that come from observing nature for a long time, in the way American Indians or native Ussuri have done. In the forest, intuition is science. When trying to explore a logical path in nature, we come across many forks in the road. We must pause at each and consider it. Collecting all our intuitions and adding up all the physical evidence we find helps us arrive at a scientific decision.</p>

    <p class="ind">All living things that move leave traces created by their mass pressing on the surface of the planet. This is a law of physics and an important record of life on earth. If we look at these records, we can learn a great deal from them. Traces help us deduce the past and predict the future. The larger the animals, the more we can learn from the traces they leave behind—where they like to go, what they do there, why they do it, and so on. We can also determine their sex and age range, thereby identifying individual tigers.</p>

    <p class="ind">To identify an individual tiger, it’s easier to first divide by gender and then into categories such as juveniles, sub-adults, and adults. Tigers under the age of one are juveniles, aged one to three are sub-adults, and over three are adults. Sub-adult tigers are roughly the same size as adult tigers, making it difficult to tell them apart just by looking at them. Sub-adults are large but not completely independent, which means they have less experience. They’re also sexually inactive and mentally immature.</p>

    <p class="ind">The most important factor in telling individual tigers apart is their prints, specifically the width of the ball of their paws. This is because tigers have more highly evolved paws than other animals do. The width of the front paws is especially telling. Tigers’ front paws are larger and have a greater width-to-length ratio than their hind ones.</p>

    <p class="ind">A mature male tiger has an average paw width of ten and a half to thirteen centimeters. The widest, thirteen centimeters, usually belongs to the Great King in his prime. There are past records of wider paws, but hardly any paws have reached even thirteen centimeters in recent years.</p>

    <p class="ind">A mature female tiger has an average paw width of eight and a half to ten centimeters. An unofficial record shows that a female tiger paw can be up to eleven centimeters wide, but within the small population we have today, the widths hardly ever reach ten centimeters.</p>

    <p class="ind">If the front paw width is less than eight centimeters, the print definitely belongs to a juvenile, and if the width exceeds ten and a half, it’s definitely an adult male. But if the measurements are anything from eight and a half to ten centimeters, it could be a mature female or a sub-adult male. With these cases, we determine the sex by factoring in their stride and the length of their bodies. Because tigers’ paws develop faster than their bodies, a sub-adult tiger’s paws may be roughly the same as an adult’s, but its steps and body length will be shorter.</p>

    <p class="ind">I got chills as I followed the fresh tiger tracks in the snowy forest. The chills were not like the ones brought on by the cold outside, but more like a psychological coldness that came from deep within. As I followed the track with my heart beating wildly, I came up on signs of the tiger frolicking and resting in the snow. When I saw the clear imprints of a tiger who had been innocently rolling around and playing, my frantic heart finally calmed. It gave me great comfort to know that tigers like to have fun and bond with each other.</p>

    <p class="ind">Sometimes I see the traces tigers leave by crouching gingerly in the snow. Tigers often sit in this sphinx-like position—hind legs tucked in, front paws stretched out neatly in front—right before they pounce on prey or when they are on alert. The sphinx position with the tiger’s hips rotated to the side is called a half-sphinx. A tiger lies in the half-sphinx position when it’s resting. If there is ice in the spot where the tiger was lying, it means the snow melted from the tiger’s body heat and froze again when it left; in other words, the tiger had taken a long break or a nap in that spot.</p>

    <p class="ind">We can use these traces to measure the length of a tiger’s body. When measuring body lengths using traces of sphinx or half-sphinx positions, we use the length between the base of the tiger’s tail and the chest. We do not include parts that can be tucked in, such as the legs or the tail, as part of the body length. If we find a trace where the tiger had lain down completely, we measure from its head to its bottom.</p>

    <p class="ind">According to <em>The Terrestrial Mammals of the Far East of</em> USSR (1984), an adult male tiger’s average body length (from head to tip of tail) is 3 meters and its average body weight 200 kilograms. The largest ever recorded, in the <em>Russian Red Book</em> (1987), was 4.17 meters long and weighed 350 kilograms. The Bengal tigers that live in India, Nepal, or Bangladesh, on the other hand, are on average 2.5 meters long and weigh 150 kilograms. The harsh climate and environment made the Siberian tiger evolve in different ways than tigers in tropical regions. To reduce body heat loss, the Siberian tiger became larger to reduce its volume-to-surface ratio.</p>

    <p class="ind">The same tiger paw can leave different prints depending on the condition of the surface the tiger walks on. Prints on the right kind of mud are accurate representations of the paw. But if the mud contains too much water, the mud slides down as the paw is lifted and makes the print smaller. Dry sand makes prints with large overall outlines because the sand is blown off on impact, but the size of the paw print itself shrinks when sand slides down as the paw is lifted. Prints on fluffy snow are larger, because the snowflakes are also blown off on impact as the paw lands. Prints left after a heavy snow are difficult even to recognize, for the snow collapses as the paw is pulled up. We measure the depth and width of the hole to guess the paw size, but it’s difficult to get an exact measurement.</p>

    <p class="ind">We must also pay close attention to the surface of the print. Is the mud jutting out between the toes wet or dry? Is it well defined or worn down? These questions help us determine when the tiger was there. If there is water in the print, is the water murky or clear? If the former, the tiger went by less than an hour ago; if the latter, it’s been more than an hour. If there are ripples in the water, the tiger went by minutes ago. If the print is on grass, we look at which direction the grass is leaning, how wilted the stems are that have snapped under its paws, and, if it’s morning, whether dew is clinging to the blades of grass. A snapped branch, a rock out of place, a tuft of hair stuck in a tree trunk, and other things in nature that are out of place all demand our careful attention.</p>

    <p class="ind">Following a trace is the act of taking one step toward specific from vague. A vague trace becomes clearer with every observation and investigation until it becomes a small but vivid truth as real as something I see before my very eyes. One fact connects to another, and these small facts come together to form the whole truth. Following traces, therefore, is an act of outlining a living thing’s way of existence.</p>

    <p class="ind">All traces disappear with time. The wind removes them, the rain washes them away, and the snow covers all. The cleaning crew of the forest takes apart the carcasses of living things, and time silently erases everything, including the traces of seasons.</p>

    <p class="ind">Bones, however, last a while. Other things may soon erode, but bones maintain their shape for much longer. Bones are the history of a forest and, in their own way, immortal. Just as you may be moved when you read a classic novel, I am inspired by the history of the forest I read in bones. Traces are physical things that sometimes have spiritual properties that reverberate in our souls. And so the traces I find always remain in my heart.</p>
